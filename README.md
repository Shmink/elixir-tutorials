# Elixir tutorial

From the udemy course "complete elixir and phoenix bootcamp"

### Cards

This was a tutorial where by you were to make a full pack of cards, shuffle them and deal 
as many cards as the user requests.

### Identicon

This tutorial shows you how to make an _identicon_. You see these generated images here on GitHub
for example when a user hasn't uploaded their own profile picture and they remain with this 
generated identicon. It takes an input from the user. Using that you create an MD5 checksum and 
create a list of random numbers from it. With that we can choose a colour for the squares in the 
image and then choose what squares should be coloured. The idea with these identicons is that
they are mirrored. My username, 'shmink' gave a nice result:
